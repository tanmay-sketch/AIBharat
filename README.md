# Awesome AI By Bharat
This repository contains a hand-curated resources of Artificial Intelligence technologies built by India.

While 'AI-For-Bharat' is valuable, it doesn't quite encompass the spirit of self-reliance that 'AI-By-Bharat' entails. Who truly owns the AI technology when we use cloud services or open-source frameworks? ü§î It's a complex matter to define, but imagine a litmus test: if there were sanctions against India, would your AI-powered product or technology still function? üí™
Having said that, this repo should have place for AI-For-Bharat efforts as well. So, go ahead and suggest those as well.

A similar collection of resources can be found at [The Indic NLP Catalog](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indicnlp_catalog)
